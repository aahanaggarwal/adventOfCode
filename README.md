# adventOfCode

Just my work on advent of code. I started in 2021, but might work backwards slowly. Will attempt to do a new language for every year :)

The years, in order of when I did them:

1. 2021 - Python3
2. 2020 - Rust

I am planning to do 2019 in Go if time permits.

# Synacor

I also have the Synacor challenge on this, which I will attempt to do in Rust.
